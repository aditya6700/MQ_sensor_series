# MQ_sensor_series

MQ sensor integration with Arduino 

Detecting and measuring pollution and the main gases (the ones we may come across in our daily life) is always relevant; 
such operations are carried out by means of specific sensors, that are often very expensive. Luckily, 
for a while it is possible to find low-cost, reliable sensors for sale: thatâ€™s the ones from the MQ series.

The following sensors code is available
 MQ-2 = flammable gases such as LPG and propane
 MQ-3 =  ethanol
